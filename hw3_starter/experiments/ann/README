There are two ways to use the ANN package:

a. The simplest (but somewhat shortsighted) way is to drag and drop
   the ANN folder into one of the already-existing folders containing
   classes for your Java development environment (e.g., JBuilder,
   CodeWarrior, Sun SDK, etc.).  The drawback is that if you uninstall, 
   delete, or upgrade your environment, then you will likely lose the 
   ANN folder and have to redo this in your new environment.

b. The preferable way is to create a folder or directory in which
   you will store your own packages and libraries, drag-and-drop the
   ANN folder into this folder, and then set up an environment variable
   named CLASSPATH that points to this folder.  For example:

 1) If you use Windows and your folder is named C:\Java\ClassLib,
    add the following line to your autoexec.bat file:
 
      SET CLASSPATH=.;C:\JAVA\CLASSLIB;%CLASSPATH%

 2) If you use MacOS X and your folder is named /home/jca/java/classLib,
    add the following line to the .cshrc file in your home directory:

      setenv CLASSPATH .:/home/jca/java/classLib/

 3) If you use Linux and your folder is named /home/jca/java/classLib,
    add the following line to the .bashrc file in your home directory:

      export CLASSPATH=.:/home/jca/java/classLib/

Then restart any shells (or logout and log back in again) and javac
and java should be able to find the ann library.
